# LoanPal: Because Lending Money Shouldn't Be a Mystery! 💸

Welcome to the **LoanPal** repository!

Ever lent a friend a few bucks for that *"totally essential"* late-night pizza, only to have it vanish into the black hole of forgotten debts? Or maybe you're that generous soul constantly spotting family members, but tracking it all feels like herding cats?

**Worry no more — LoanPal is here to save your day (and your relationships)!**

This project marks my journey into the wonderful world of **React Native with Expo**, building a clean, user-friendly app to manage personal and group loans. Think of it as your financial memory — but way cooler and a lot less judgy than your bank. 😎

## 💡 What is LoanPal?

**LoanPal** is a mobile app designed to remove the awkwardness and confusion from personal lending. Whether it’s a quick spot to a friend or a shared group expense, LoanPal helps you:

- 💵 **Track who owes what**  
- ⏳ **Set repayment terms**  
- 🔔 **Get notified without the awkwardness**

No more “remember that time I paid for your…” conversations!

## ✨ Core Functionalities (The Nitty-Gritty, But Still Fun)

### 🏡 1. Home Sweet Home (Dashboard)

Your personal command center! A clean overview of your lending life:

- **Total Due** – See how much you're owed at a glance  
- **Global Reimbursements** – Perfect for tracking group loans  
- **Statistics** – Reimbursement progress & overdue alerts  
- **Recent Loans** – Stay on top of who's paid and who's pending

### 🤝 2. Your Lending Network (Contacts)

Keeping tabs on everyone you’ve lent money to (or borrowed from):

- **View Contacts** – Your lending circle, cleanly listed  
- **Contact Details** – Individual loan history & current status  
- **Add New Contacts** – Expand your network (responsibly, of course)

---

### ⚙️ 3. Personal Touch (Profiles & Settings)

Customize your experience and keep things secure:

- **Profile Management** – Keep your info fresh  
- **Security** – Biometric login & multi-factor authentication  
- **Transfer Methods** – Configure how you send/receive money

## 🚀 What’s Next? (Coming Soon)
